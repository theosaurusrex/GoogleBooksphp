# GoogleBooksphp

This app was built using in PHP and uses the Google Books API to load book information.

Users can use the search field to search for free and paid books in the Google library.

Information displayed is the book title, author(s), publisher, an image of the book, and a link to more information.

The app tells the user when there is missing information for any field, as well as handles multiple authors.

The app currently only delivers 10 results. 

Future improvements might be adding pages of more results, interfacing with the Google user's bookshelf or another service/api. Also, better styles and algorithms, and testing edge cases.
